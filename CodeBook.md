## Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
## Version 1.0

### About the Original Data:
> The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

> The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### About This Data:
This dataset includes a subset of accelerometer and gyroscope data with mean values over each of the 30 subjects and 6 activity.

#### The activities include:
* WALKING
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
* SITTING
* STANDING
* LAYING

##### Each feature name is denoted in several parts, which is explained below:
- [t, f]: time, frequency domain signal
- [Body, Gravity]: body, gravity acceleration signal
- [Acc, Gyro]: Accelerator vs. Gyroscope signal
- [Jerk]: body linear acceleration and angular velocity signal
- [Mag]: magnitude of the 3-dimensional signal using Euclidean norm
- [mean(), std()]: mean or standard deviation values for the signal
- [X, Y, Z]: indicates 3-axial signal in 3 different directions
